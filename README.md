# OUF_grad_fast

This directory contains some C++ code that is used to fit the [Ornstein-Uhlenbeck factor (OUF) model](https://github.com/madelineabbott/OUF).  The C++ code calculates gradients of the likelihood for this OUF model with respect to the measurement submodel parameters.  It can be installed in R by running the code below.
